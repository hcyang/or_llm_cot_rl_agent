        "question": "The Aircraft Assignment Problem aims to assign aircraft to routes in order to minimize the total cost while satisfying demand constraints with available aircraft. The problem involves a set of aircraft and a set of routes. Given the costs of assigning an aircraft to a route. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the assignment. There are limited available aircraft. It is constrained that the number of each aircraft allocated does not exceed its available number. Given the demand of each route and the capabilities (the largest number of people can be carried) of an aircraft for a route. The demand constraint ensures that the total allocation for each route satisfies the demand. The problem seeks to find the most cost-effective assignment of aircraft to routes.",

        "question": "The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is the problem of deciding a landing time on an appropriate runway for each aircraft in a given set of aircraft such that each aircraft lands within a predetermined time window; and separation criteria between the landing of an aircraft, and the landing of all successive aircraft, are respected. We are given the earliest landing time, latest landing time, target landing time, and penalties for landing before or after the target landing time for each aircraft. There is also a separation time that represents the minimum time required between the landing of two aircraft. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total penalties of landing before or after the target time for each aircraft. The problem includes several constraints. The order constraint ensures that the aircrafts land in a specific order. The separation constraint ensures that there is enough separation time between the landing of aircraft. The lower and upper time window constraints ensure that each aircraft lands within its respective earliest and latest time windows.",

We are given a set of alloys available on the market and a set of required elements for the blend, the percentage composition data of each required element in each alloy, the desired blend percentage of each required element, the price of each alloy. The decision is the amount of each alloy to be purchased, which is continuous. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the alloy purchased. There are two constraints. The first set of constraints ensures that the desired blend percentage of each required element is met. The second constraint ensures that the total amount of alloys purchased is equal to 1.",

        "question": "A telecom company needs to build a set of cell towers to provide signal coverage for the inhabitants of a given city. A number of potential locations where the towers could be built have been identified. The towers have a fixed range, and due to budget constraints only a limited number of them can be built. Given these restrictions, the company wishes to provide coverage to the largest percentage of the population possible. To simplify the problem, the company has split the area it wishes to cover into a set of regions, each of which has a known population. The goal is then to choose which of the potential locations the company should build cell towers on in order to provide coverage to as many people as possible.",
